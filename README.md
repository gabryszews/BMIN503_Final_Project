BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains the QMD and HTML files for my final project. My project explored associations between dietary inflammatory potential and a set of allergic, immunologic, and cardiometabolic diseases using the NHANES database. Additional information about cohort design, variables (including a data dictionary, Table 1), and results/conclusions are detailed in the actual final project files.
